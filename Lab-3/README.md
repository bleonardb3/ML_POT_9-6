# Build, Train, and Save a Neural Network Model using Watson Studio

## Introduction:

This lab will use the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) computer vision data set to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to recognize handwritten digits. The Watson Studio neural network flow editor, Watson Studio experiment builder and the Watson Machine Learning component  will be used to build, train, and save the model.  

## Objectives:

Upon completing the lab, you will:

1. Create Cloud Object Storage buckets to contain the input and result files
1. Use the neural network flow editor to create a neural network design from an example.  
1. Use the Experiment builder to set up a training definition to train the neural network model
1. Monitor the training progress and results.  
1. Save the trained model
