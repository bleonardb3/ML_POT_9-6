For Lab-4, there are 3 alternative labs you can select, or select multiple if you have time. Each lab is based on the Titanic data set, often used in Kaggle competitions.   

1. [Lab-4a](https://github.com/bleonardb3/ML-POT/tree/master/Lab-4/Lab-4a) - This lab will use the Watson Machine Learning capability to create a machine learning model based on the Titanic data set. The model will be deployed in the IBM Cloud, and an application will be built that uses the deployed machine learning model to predict survivability given passenger characteristics. 

1. [Lab-4b](https://github.com/bleonardb3/ML-POT/tree/master/Lab-4/Lab-4b) - This lab will guide participants in using the Watson Studio SPSS Modeler capability to explore, prepare, and model passenger data from the Titanic. The SPSS Modeler is a drag and drop capability to build machine learning pipelines.

1. [Lab-4c](https://github.com/bleonardb3/ML-POT/tree/master/Lab-4/Lab-4c) - This lab will leverage Spark machine learning (SparkML) in a Jupyter notebook to predict survivability using pyspark and a supervised learning model.
