For Lab-4, there are 4 labs that you can select that show other features of Watson Studio. Each lab is based on the Titanic data set, often used in Kaggle competitions.   

1. [Lab-1](https://github.com/bleonardb3/AA/tree/master/Lab-1) - The first lab will use the Watson Machine Learning Model Builder capability to create a machine learning model based on the Titanic data set. The model will be deployed in the IBM Cloud, and an application will be built that uses the deployed machine learning model to predict survivability given passenger characteristics.

1. [Lab-2](https://github.com/bleonardb3/AA/tree/master/Lab-2) - The second lab will guide participants in using the Watson Studio SPSS Modeler capability to explore, prepare, and model passenger data from the Titanic. The SPSS Modeler is a drag and drop capability to build machine learning pipelines.   

1. [Lab-3](https://github.com/bleonardb3/AA/tree/master/Lab-3) - The third lab features the Data Refinery tool, a fully managed self-service data preparation facility. 

1. [Lab-4](https://github.com/bleonardb3/AA/tree/master/Lab-4) - The fourth lab will leverage Spark machine learning (SparkML) in a Jupyter notebook to predict survivability using pyspark and a supervised learning model.
