## Watson Machine Learning Lab 

## Introduction:

In this lab, you will use IBM's Watson Machine Learning GUI to train, evaluate, and deploy a Watson Machine Learning model based on the Titanic dataset. This is a common data set used in Kaggle competitions. 

## Objectives:

Upon completing the lab, you will:

1. Become familiar with the Watson Machine Learning GUI.  
2. Train/Evaluate a machine learning model
3. Deploy a machine learning model. 
4. Deploy an application that invokes the machine learning model service.
